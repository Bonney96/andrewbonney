## Overview

Gateway Watch is a monitoring and analytics platform designed for tracking real-time data streams with high reliability. The system processes and visualizes data-dense information in an accessible, queryable format.

Engineered for performance-critical environments where uptime and data accuracy are non-negotiable.

## Technical Approach

- **TypeScript** end-to-end for type-safe data pipelines and reliable stream processing
- **Static frontend** on Cloudflare Pages for globally distributed, low-latency access
- **Real-time data handling** designed for high-throughput ingestion and visualization

## Design Goals

- **Reliability-first:** architecture built around uptime guarantees and fault-tolerant data handling
- **Performance-critical:** optimized for data-dense environments where latency directly affects utility
- **Accessible visualization:** surfacing complex data streams in human-readable dashboards
