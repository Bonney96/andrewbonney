Built a custom ML-based pose estimation system using DeepLabCut to track zebrafish behavior in a purpose-built experimental rig.

### Methodology

- **DeepLabCut** neural network for markerless pose estimation
- Custom training pipeline on labeled video frames
- Automated extraction of behavioral metrics from tracked keypoints
- High-throughput analysis of locomotion patterns and stimulus responses

### Impact

- Enabled quantitative behavioral phenotyping previously done by manual observation
- Processed thousands of frames per experiment with consistent accuracy
- Reproducible tracking across multiple experimental sessions
