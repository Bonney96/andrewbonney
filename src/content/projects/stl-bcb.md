## The Problem

St. Louis has a rich but fragmented bioinformatics community — researchers at WashU, SLU, industry labs, and biotech startups working in parallel with minimal cross-institution visibility. No central hub existed for connecting people, sharing resources, or organizing community events.

## The Solution

Built and deployed a community platform as the digital home for the STL BCB Collective. The site serves as a directory, resource hub, and event board for bioinformatics and computational biology researchers across the St. Louis metro area.

## Technical Approach

- **Framework:** Astro (static output) deployed on Cloudflare Pages for zero-maintenance, globally distributed hosting
- **Design:** Accessible, mobile-first responsive layout with clean information hierarchy
- **Infrastructure:** Automatic CI/CD deployments via Cloudflare's build pipeline, custom domain with automatic SSL

## Impact

- Active platform connecting researchers across WashU, SLU, and St. Louis industry partners
- Zero operational overhead — static architecture with no server maintenance
- Provides discoverability for researchers who otherwise lack cross-institution visibility
- Serves as the primary online presence for in-person community meetups and events
